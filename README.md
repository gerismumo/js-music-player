Simple Music Player
This is a simple music player web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play and control audio tracks, featuring basic functionalities such as play, pause, next, previous, and progress tracking.

Features
Play/pause functionality: Users can play or pause the currently selected audio track.
Next/previous track: Users can navigate between multiple tracks in the playlist.
Progress bar: A progress bar indicates the current position within the track and allows users to seek to different positions.
Keyboard shortcuts: Supports keyboard shortcuts for common actions (e.g., spacebar to play/pause).

Usage
Open the web application in your browser.
Click the play button to start playing the first track.
Use the pause button to pause the currently playing track.
Click the next button to move to the next track in the playlist.
Similarly, use the previous button to move to the previous track.
The progress bar displays the current position within the track. Click on different positions to seek to that position.
Customization
To add more tracks, simply update the Audios array in the JavaScript code (script.js) with the file paths of the additional audio files.
Customize the appearance of the player by modifying the CSS styles in the styles.css file.
